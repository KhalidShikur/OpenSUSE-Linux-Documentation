# OpenSUSE-Linux-Documentation

## Documentation Description

This project documents the installation, configuration, and system-level exploration of the openSUSE Leap 15.5 Linux distribution in a virtualized environment. It covers detailed steps for setting up openSUSE using VirtualBox, resolving installation issues, working with the Btrfs filesystem, and using tools like YaST, Zypper, and Snapper. The goal is to provide a practical, hands-on guide for students and professionals to learn system programming, Linux administration, and open-source development. All procedures follow official openSUSE guidelines and best practices for stable, secure, and maintainable systems.

## System-Call Description

This project demonstrates how to safely flush file content to disk using the fdatasync() system call in C. It includes a simple program that writes to a file and forces synchronization of the fileâ€™s data without syncing metadata. The implementation helps understand how user-space applications interact with the Linux kernel for data integrity. This is critical for building robust logging, database, or embedded systems.
